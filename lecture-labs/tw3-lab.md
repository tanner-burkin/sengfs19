# TW3 - Tuesday Lab, Week 3

## Practice Requirements Gathering
1. In Pairs, solicit requirements from each other for a system that is used to manage photographic images for a newspaper. 
	- Who are the stakeholders? 
	- Who are the users? 
	- What are the system requirements? 
	- What are the functional requirements. 
2. Whoever goes first, submit that summary as a markdown document in your personal repository. 
3. Then, the second person will extend that document by asking clarifying questions, ultimately submitting a revised version as a markdown document in their own repository by the end of class.
